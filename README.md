🚀 Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

🔹 Course: Operating Systems (CSE316)
🔹 Objective: Simulate & visualize various page replacement algorithms
🔹 Algorithms Implemented: FIFO, LRU, Optimal

⸻

📌 Project Overview

The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is an interactive educational tool designed to help students and developers understand page replacement strategies in Operating Systems.

💡 Features:
✅ Custom page reference input & frame size configuration
✅ Step-by-step simulation of FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms
✅ Graphical visualization of page faults and algorithm performance
✅ Easy-to-use GUI powered by Tkinter

📂 Modules

📝 Page Reference Input Module

🔹 Enter custom page reference strings
🔹 Supports dynamic frame size selection

🔄 Algorithm Simulation Module

Implements three fundamental page replacement algorithms:
1️⃣ First-In-First-Out (FIFO) – Oldest page gets replaced first.
2️⃣ Least Recently Used (LRU) – Page that hasn’t been used for the longest time gets replaced.
3️⃣ Optimal Page Replacement – The page that will not be used for the longest gets replaced.

📊 Visualization Module

📌 Graphical insights into page fault rates
📌 Cumulative page fault timeline
📌 Performance metrics for comparison
